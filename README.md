# Test Blog with Papermod theme

This is my new blog for learning purposes. I would like to learn [markdown](markdownguide.org) refresh my programming knowledge.
In my early ages is started with  
- MS-Dos
- Basic

Later I wrote some program with *Turbo Pascal*. I edited web pages with *HTML* Most of my knowledge are now out of date. But the old **DOS** commands are usefiul in CMD and the logics of Basic and Pascal are good to understand the logics of programming. And HTML is necessary to programming web for now.

I started the layout with the [hugo](https://gohugo.io) [papermod](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-papermod/)theme.
